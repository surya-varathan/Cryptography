# Comparison

## EffTest1 (Recursive)

This program is based on the naive approach to find the multiplicative inverse of a given number in its corresponding group.

## EffTest2 (Iterative)

This program is based on the extended Euclidean approach to find the inverse of a given number in its corresponding group.

## Result

It is trivial from executing the codes that the iterative method computes faster than the recurive method which takes exponential time.
